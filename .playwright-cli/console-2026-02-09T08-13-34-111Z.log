Avoid using aria-hidden on a focused element or its ancestor. Consider using the inert attribute instead, which will also prevent focus. For more details, see the aria-hidden section of the WAI-ARIA specification at https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-hidden.
Element with focus: <button.mantine-focus-auto mantine-active sidesheet-footer-cancel m_77c9d27d mantine-Button-root m_87cf2631 mantine-UnstyledButton-root>
Ancestor with aria-hidden: <aside.sidesheet > @ http://localhost:4173/:0
